* scheduled snapshots at the same time often step on each other, causing
  one or both to fail, or to produce the wrong error messages if they
  would have failed anyway. (monthly default TOD is 22:05 for all sources)

* remove_source fails if the source fileset has been removed by hand
  already.  it should at least remove the config file entries for
  that source.
